class SelfPipe:
    """A Python implementation of djb's `self-pipe trick`, focussed on simplicity and usability.

    Briefly: handling Unix signals in a long-lived process, while commonly used, is fraught
    with difficulties.  They're racy, the code used in the handler has many restrictions which
    aren't enforced by the compiler or platform C library but which can cause catastrophic
    errors which are essentially impossible to debug.  Handling them in a program with an event
    loop is particularly tricky.

    This class encapsulates all the difficulty and implements the One True Safe signal handling
    technique invented by djb (Daniel J. Bernstein) around 1990.

    To use:
        1. Create a single instance of this class and keep a reference to it in your program
           or main object.  Pass it a list of 1 or more signals you want to catch.
        2. In your event loop, call `.poll()` on this instance.  If a signal has been received
           since the previous call to poll(), it will be returned in the format of a
           signal.Signals enum instance.  Otherwise, the result is None.
        3. If multiple signals are received, polling will return them one at a time, in the
           order they were received.
        4. You can supply an optional timeout value to poll() to cause the process to sleep
           and await a signal rather than immediately returning None.

    If you're using multiple threads, all calls to create or use this object must be done from
    the main thread.

        Note that not all signals can be caught and handled, and some that can nevertheless
        do not make sense to catch.  The Python interpreter also installs default signal
        handlers for some signals (particularly SIGINT and SIGPIPE).  See the stdlib
        documentation for the signal module, and `man 7 signal` for details on individual
