    """A Python implementation of the Unix `self-pipe trick`, popularized by djb, focussed on
    simplicity and usability.

    Briefly: handling Unix signals in a long-lived process, while commonly used, is fraught
    with difficulties.  They're racy, the code used in the handler has many restrictions which
    aren't enforced by the compiler or platform C library but which can cause catastrophic
    errors which are essentially impossible to debug.  Handling them in a program with an event
    loop is particularly tricky.

    This class encapsulates all the difficulty and implements the One True Safe signal handling
    technique invented by djb (Daniel J. Bernstein) around 1990.

    If you're using multiple threads, all calls to create or use this object must be done from
    the main thread.
